Please install EJS in this directory
1. npm install ejs --save
2. npm install express --save
3. npm install express-generator
4. change directory ch4_xx
5. input command "node app.js"

I don't know why, but need "npm install cookie-parser" etc... separately
This book says that cookie-parser ... packages are included express framework from initial installation, but I need install manually.
